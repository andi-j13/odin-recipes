    <h1>How to make Classic Sangria</h1>

    <p>
        This authentic sangria recipe is a terrific version of the popular wine
        drink. You can add any fruit that you want, but I find that apples and
        pears absorb all the rum. This one is not diluted with carbonated
        beverages. I have had much success with red Burgundy wine and white rum,
        though spiced rum is nice too.
